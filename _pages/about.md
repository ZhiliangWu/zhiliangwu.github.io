I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Prof. Volker Tresp](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/) since 2018. The work is generously supported by the [MLwin](https://www.mlwin.de) project at LMU Munich and Siemens AG.


My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning in healthcare applications. We are especially interested in developing state-of-the-art clinical decision support systems to address the challenges in the high-dimensional, sparse, and sequential Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) data.


Before joining LMU Munich & Siemens AG, I received my masterâ€™s degree in [Electrical Engineering and Information Technology](https://www.ei.tum.de) from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) in 2018. I spent six months at [Mercateo AG](https://www.mercateo.com/) to conduct my master's thesis about Recommender Systems under the supervision of [PD. Martin Kleinsteuber](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=yxPGJtkAAAAJ&hl=en).
